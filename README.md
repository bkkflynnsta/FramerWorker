The FrameWorker app for iOS is a practice project introducing learners to SwiftUI
concepts, structures, and approaches.  I highly recommend this course for
beginner to intermediate Apple developers, especially those new to SwiftUI.

Sean Allen does a commendable job introducing the language, covering pros and
cons of SwiftUI, and provides solid, experience-backed tutorial on using the
most popular features of SwiftUI to build great looking apps and easily-readable
code.

This is my own customized result based on Sean's code, with some challenges
accepted to extend the functionality of the FrameWorker app, including:

- Adding a column-based Gridview
- Adding .sheet views with additional dismiss button
- Introducing @StateObject bindings
- Refactoring

Please feel free to clone or fork this project - I think there's a lot of room
for improvement

Enjoy!
